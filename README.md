# Height-Detection

This project aims to estimate a person's height using computer vision techniques.
An A4 paper is used as a reference, and a person's height is calculated based on the ratio of pixel heights.

Files and Descriptions:

- A4PaperDetect.py – Detects an A4 paper in an image.
- personDetect.py – Detects a person in an image.
- heightdetection.py – Calculates a person's height using the dimensions of the detected A4 paper. (This is the combined script for the height-detection system.)
- app.py – Runs a Flask server to visualize the system.
- index.html – Frontend interface for displaying the height detection results.
